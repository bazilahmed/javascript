# javascript

In this project I have used UFO sample dataset in json format and created a website to display the data in the html table format. 
Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, DOM. 

Details - 

Automatic Table and Date Search

1. Created a basic HTML web page with the a presentable layout and a table to load the data. 
2. Using the UFO dataset in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, I have writen the code that appends a table to this web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.
3. Table columns - date/time, city, state, country, shape, durationInMinutues and comment.
4. Used a date form in my HTML document and writen JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the date/time column to find rows that match user input.
5. If no matching date is entered the table is reloaded with all the original entries.
